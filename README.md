# _2023_flores-tellez_YTHDF
This repository contains simulation input and analysis scripts to reproduce data for Figures in Flores-Tellez et al., 2023.
The input protein density arrays are available on Zenodo and should be stored in a folder "../slab" (as defined in the notebook).

Note that several modules in the calvados 0.2.0 package (subfolder "calvados") are in development stage and should be used with care. Please contact soren.bulow@bio.ku.dk if you plan on using this version of the package for your own project.
